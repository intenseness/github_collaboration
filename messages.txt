Hello Gabe how is it going my dude?

It's going pretty well Connor. How about yourself?

It is going well. Now what is your favorite movie quote?

"General Kenobi"~ General Grievous

My favorite are "What are you going to do bleed on me?" ~King Arthur “It's just a flesh wound.” ~Black Knight, both are from Monty Python. 

Those are some very fine quotes my young padawan.

Why yes they trully are!
